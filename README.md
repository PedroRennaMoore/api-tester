Take a look at the Project: [https://api-tester-b9e21.web.app/](https://api-tester-b9e21.web.app/)

Hello, I recently worked on a frontend project for an API Tester and I would like to share some of my experience. It was a challenging project that allowed me to learn a lot about different areas of React.

During development, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in various technologies. It was a great opportunity to apply and consolidate my skills in state management, routing, componentization, and testing.

In addition, I learned a lot about the importance of responsive design and accessibility, which are fundamental elements in any current web project.

It was a very enriching and challenging experience, but I am satisfied with the results achieved. I am always looking for new projects that allow me to continue learning and evolving as a frontend developer.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST API, React.

Here are some images of the Project:
